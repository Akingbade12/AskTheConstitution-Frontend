# Ask The Constitution

Ask The Constitution is a project borne out of the need to educate Nigerians and help lawyers discover new and innovative ways of using technology to promote access to justice and deepen the
understanding of Nigeria's constitutional framework.
By providing an online platform where individuals can ask questions about the constitution and receive clear, concise, and accurate answers, Ask The Constitution aims to empower Nigerians with knowledge and understanding of their constitutional rights and obligations. Additionally, the project seeks to foster collaboration between legal professionals and technologists in developing solutions that
enhance access to justice, promote transparency, and advance the rule of law in Nigeria.
